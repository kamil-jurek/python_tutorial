# To print a string in Python 3, just write:
print("This line will be printed.")

# Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")

### EXCERCISE
print("### EXCERCISE")

# Use the "print" function to print the line "Hello, World!".
print("Goodbye, World!")
